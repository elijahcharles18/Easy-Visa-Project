# Easy Visa Project

## Overview

The **Easy Visa Project** aims to address the challenges faced by business communities in the United States in identifying and attracting the right talent. With a high demand for skilled human resources, companies often look for talented individuals both locally and abroad. This project leverages data analysis and machine learning to streamline the process of hiring foreign workers while ensuring compliance with U.S. immigration policies.

## Problem Statement

### Context
Business communities in the U.S. face challenges in sourcing qualified and hard-working individuals. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) allows foreign workers to enter the U.S. on a temporary or permanent basis. The Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) oversees job certification applications to ensure compliance with statutory requirements and protect U.S. workers' wages and working conditions.

### Objective
This project seeks to optimize the foreign labor certification process by using data-driven approaches to:
- Predict the likelihood of job certification approval.
- Identify factors influencing approval decisions.
- Provide actionable insights for employers and policymakers.

## Features
- **Data Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of foreign labor certification data to uncover trends and insights.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Predictive models to estimate job certification outcomes.
- **Visualizations**: Clear and interactive visualizations to aid decision-making.
